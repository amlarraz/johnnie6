# Autonomous RC car code

## Introduction:

This code is the beginning of my RC-autonomous-car project. The final aim of this project is to participate in an autonomous RC-car racing.

## Pre-requisites:

The pre-requisites to use this code are:

* Buy a RC car: I've based all this project in this car: [SunFounder](https://www.sunfounder.com/smart-video-car-kit-v2-0.html)
* Make the car and follow the instructions in the book to install and run the server. All the code is provided by SunFounder and you can find it [here](https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_PiCar-V)
* The code/libraries necessary to run this code are: 
    * python 3.7
    * OpenCV 4.2.0.32
    * Numpy 1.18.1

__IMPORTANT NOTES__: 
* All the code will be in constantly updated (This is an alive project)
* All this code is based in this car, by the moment I use all the libraries, servers and servos drivers provided by SunFounder. Maybe in the future I will create my own drivers, servers, etc.

## How I can start?
